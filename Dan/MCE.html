          <h2>MCDA Description</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Context</b>
            <li>
              The purpose of this analysis is to find a suitable location
              for a new hospital in the City of Guelph, which is essential
              to meet the increasing demand for health care services in
              a city with a growing population and aging demographic.
              The Guelph General Hospital is a 165-bed facility with
              roughly 1200 staff. The building needs substantial
              upgrades as it is was first established in 1875 with only
              small additions added since then. This analysis is based off
              the assumption that federal funding will allow for a
              completely new rebuild in a larger more accessible
              location.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Study Site</b>
            <li>
              Guelph is located in the Southwestern Ontario, about 1-
              hour drive from Toronto. The availability of a Go Train and
              bus services to and from Toronto has made the City of
              Guelph a very suitable location to live for those
              commuting back and forth on a daily basis. Due to the
              easy accessibility to Toronto the population has grown
              rapidly in recent years putting increased strain on the
              health care system. The cityâ€™s boarders are expanding in
              all directions with rapid development happening around
              the downtown core. This makes it a critical time for
              municipal and federal planners to assess a location for a
              new hospital while there is still undeveloped real estate
              available.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Methodology</b>
            <li>
              The overall methodology of this analysis was done in
              several progressive steps. First, the data was collected form
              two main sources which were the City of Guelph and
              Ontario Base Map data, both of which are open source.
              Next data was prepared and managed by projecting to NAD
              1983 UTM Zone 17N and clipped to the study extent of a
              portion of Wellington County which encompassed the City
              of Guelph. After this, 7 criteria surfaces were developed
              which can be seen below in the following images. Using
              AHP derived weights for each criterion a weighted overlay
              was developed to output a weighted suitability surface.
              Finally, 5 suitable regions for a new hospital location were
              derived by using the locate regions tool to obtain the final
              map output for this analysis.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Results</b>
            <li>
              Based on the available data and chosen criteria an accurate
              model was produced with 5 suitable locations. The final
              output of the model resulted in a choice location where the
              current hospital already resides (2nd best option). Thus, this
              result was left in as consideration for planners as they may
              wish to just add substantial expansion to the current
              infrastructure. The number one result is in a location that
              accurately meets all 5 criteria, and to add to this
              achievement, is located close to the University of Guelph
              and within a vacant field that has no current construction
              projects.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Conclusion</b>
            <li>
              The results of this analysis show that the final weighted
              suitability surface and ultimately the 5 suitable locations
              successfully met the goals of this analysis. The spatial
              distribution of the 5 suitable locations give municipal and
              federal planners options when considering the best site.
              There is also room for improvement in this analysis. By
              altering the AHP weights and suitability scores to reflect
              different levels of importance varying results can be
              achieved. The current scores where based off preliminary
              literature reviews and not professional experience, so this
              could make a big difference when conduction similar
              research in the future.
