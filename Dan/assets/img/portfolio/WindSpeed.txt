#Name: Hurricane Wind Speen Calculator: Version 1.2. Date Modified: 09.29.19. 
#Modifications Include: Ability to choose units for pressure values and windspeed units.
#This program was creted to calculate the wind speed of a hurricane using the formula: vm= a (pn-pc) x
#Formula Breakdown: Vms is maximum wind speed in knots. a is a constant dependent on location (19-(latitude/5)) (13.6 in Atlantic and E. Pacific, 15 or 14.2 in Indian Ocean). pn is external pressure in mb (ambient/environmental). pc is minimum central pressure in mb (center of eye).
